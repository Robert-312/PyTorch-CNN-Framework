    "- **Subscriber List** - A list of email addresses that have opted into receiving emails from the company.  A list have have many emails.  A company can have many subscriber lists.  An email can belong to many lists and many companies.  But a subscriber list can only belong to one company.\n",
    "- **Campaign** - An email message send out by a company.  This email is sent to some or all the subscribers on the list.  With the exception of some limited personalization, all subscribed receive the same content.  A list can have many campaigns, but a campaign can only have one subscriber list.\n",
    "- **Inbox** - What the contact sees as a unique message in their inbox (Outlook, GMail, etc.).  If a company sends a single campaign to 1 million contacts, there will be 1 million InboxIDs for that campaign.\n",
    "- **Request** - A tracking HTTP request from an action the contact takes on a message in their inbox.  There are several types of requests, but they are primarily Opens which are pixel image reqeusts and Clicks.\n",
    "- **Link** - A clickable and trackable URL embedded in the email message.  The tracking system identifies the click, saved the tracking information and returns a redirect URL so the contact gets to their intended URL destination.\n",
    "- **AS Number/Name** - Who owns the block of IP address.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)\n",
    "- **CIDR** - A notation of shows us what range of IP address are in a block. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing\n",

    "## Columns\n",
    " - **Company** - Who owns the campaign\n",
    " - **InboxID** - Uniquely identifies the Campaign and the email it was sent to.\n",
    " - **RequestType** - \n",
    "     - *Open* - The contact downloaded images for the message.  A tracking pixel added to the HTML body of the message makes a request to the tracking system to identify who opened the message.\n",
    "     - *Read* - The message was opened for a pre-defined period of time.\n",
    "     - *Click* - The contact clicked on a URL in the message and the tracking system sees this request.\n",
    "     - *Browser Link* - The contact requested seeing the message in a web browser.  Mostly used if the message did not render well in the email client.\n",
    " - **SendDate** - The date and time (1 minute precision) of when the message was sent to that email.  If a company sends a campaign to 5 million email, the send might take 10-20 mins.  The SendDate is the date when that message was sent out and not the date the campaign started.\n",
    " - **RequestDate** - The date of the reqeust (i.e. Open or Click).\n",
    " - **Link** - A hash of the URL requested.\n",
    " - **IPAddress** - The IP Address the requested was generated from.\n",
    " - **UserAgent** - A string submitted by email clients/browsers and Bots that attempts to identify the browser type.  This can be made any string you want to it can be easily modified by Bots.\n",
    " - **AS Name** - Owner of the IP Range (see above).  Can be Null if owner not found in ASN database.\n",

    " - **CIDR Range** - The block the IPAddress belongs to (see above).  Can be Null if owner not found in ASN database.\n",

    " - **EmailDomain** (redundant with DomainID)- A unique ID of the domain of the email address the message was sent to.\n",
    " - **EmailRootLevelDomain** - The top level domain of the email domain.  i.e. fred@gamil.com - \".com\", mary@harvard.edu - \".edu\"\n",

    " - **Campaign** - A unique ID of the campaign.\n",
    " - **FirstActivityDate** - The first activity (Open, Click, etc.) that was received for a specific InboxID.  It is possible to have prior activity for the InboxID that is not captured in this dataset, but this is unlikely.\n",
    " - **FirstActivityDeviceType** - The type of device (phone, desktop) derived from parsing the User Agent.\n",

    "## Sessionization\n",
    "\n",
    " Making assessments from individual requests may not be as informative as grouping requests together.  It is not uncommon for a single InboxID to have multiple requests. For example, 20 minutes after a message was put into a contact's inbox, they might open the message (pixel request) followed by 3 or 4 link clicks.  That same contact might go back to that same message the following day and click on several more links.\n",
    " \n",
    "It might be more suspicious that requests are from a BOT if 20 clicks come in for the same InboxID in under 3 seconds or if the same IP Address requests opens from 50 different InboxIDs in a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 things needed to determine a session.  The first is how to partition or group the data.  The more obvious choices for this grouping is the InboxID, the IP Address and the combination of both the IP and Inbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing needed is the some kind of time frame algorithm.  The algorithm chosen is to include all requests for the given partition as long at duration between requests doesn't exceed a set gap. This requires a datetime column (in case, the RequestDate) and a max gap allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method below is structure in a way to allow us to use different partitioning column(s) and to append a \"session ID\" to the existing dataframe as opposed to showing a single session per row with aggregate data."
